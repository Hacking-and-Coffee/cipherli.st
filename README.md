# Cipherli.st

A portal for a collection of strong and reasonablyk secure server cipher configurations for web servers, mail daemons, OpenSSH, and more.
This site was formed from Raymii after the site was taken down and redirected to the Mozilla TLS guide. Whilst the guide on the Mozilla Wiki is a fantastic, and strongly recommended, reference, it does not have useful configurations for anything more than the web servers.
Cipherli.st was forked to maintain this reference in a public place.

Please send PRs to this repo ( Hacking-and-Coffee/cipherli.st ) unless Raymii restarts the project.
