# Cipherli.st

A portal for a collection of strong and reasonablyk secure server cipher configurations for web servers, mail daemons, OpenSSH, and more.
This site was formed from Raymii after the site was taken down and redirected to the Mozilla TLS guide. Whilst the guide on the Mozilla Wiki is a fantastic, and strongly recommended, reference, it does not have useful configurations for anything more than the web servers.
Cipherli.st was forked to maintain this reference in a public place.

Please send PRs to this repo ( Hacking-and-Coffee/cipherli.st ) unless Raymii continues the upstream repo.

I'd like to thank Raymii for creating this page; as a sysadmin on the side from my red team work, it has been invaluable on quickly getting strong endpoints up and running with various daemons, and providing reasonably secure configurations when dealing with some older clients as an option.
